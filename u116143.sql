But this time, the guru of  avant-garde cuisine of Spain, Ferr&aacute;n Adr&iacute;a, has brought us an  unbelievable style of Spanish gastronomy, which involves isolating the  ingredients of a dish in order to transform it into another form, like  making olive oil into solid foam by using liquid nitrogen.</p>\r\n<p>Chef Adria ran a Michelin 3-star restaurant near Barcelona, elBulli,  which has been praised 3 times the Best Restaurant in the World. Led by  him, elBulli, is more like a laboratory which dedicated into the  research and innovation for culinary science. One month ago, he closed  the restaurant and planed to make it a foundation for communicating with  other chefs around the world. His visit to China is looking for  opportunities to change views with pioneering chefs in China.</p>\r\n<p>Ferran Adria said, &quot;There are two Chinas. A conservative China that  is after the so-called private restaurants and a Chinese youth that  wants to party, that seeks fun. I do not think that you have to find out  anything, you just have to listen to what already exists, to make a  market study. As far as I can see, if there is a country where ''Las  Tapas'' can be popular, this is China.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>During his visit to China''s capital, he was also nominated the  &quot;Tourism Ambassador of Beijing&quot;, which will help Spanish citizens know  more about China, and meanwhile, attract Chinese tourists to his home  town.

Spring worship welcomes all saints from  heaven and earth, mainly god of the sun; and fall payback is to pay  tribute to the generous, load carrying mother earth at the end of a  harvest year. To offer respect to the land, the moon, and mother''s body  is a humane culture extended from matriarchal society. Eating moon cake  is a palatable custom of the Mid-Autumn Festival. The moon cake relief  patterns are numerous and colorful, both in terms of art and cultural  implication. Fairy tales told through moon cake relief patterns include  &quot;A pairing fish;&quot; &quot;Baby with coiled hair;&quot; &quot;Sal tree of life;&quot; and story  of the jade hare from the moon palace.</p>\r\n<p align="center"><img width="450" height="358" src="http://traditions.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/upload/2%28172%29.jpg" alt="" /></p>\r\n<p>Mid-Autumn Festival moon cake pattern showing the &quot;Sal tree of life&quot; and the jade hare from the moon palace. (Jishan, Shanxi).</p>\r\n<p>Folk customs of moon worship vary from region to region in China. The  most unforgettable I have seen was in central Shanxi. An altar was set  up in the yard to burn incense and candles. Layers of fruits piled up on  the altar as offerings to the moon fairy. Placed in the middle of the  altar was a huge round cake of one-meter in diameter, showing patterns  of radiating lotus pedals coming from the center and colorful floury  flowers and figures like &quot;Monkey eating a peach.&quot; In between of the  lotus pedals were jujubes, symbolic of life and propagation. The cake,  likening lotus to the moon and mother''s body, was a prayer for a bumper  harvest, family reunion and prosperity.</p>\r\n<p align="center"><img width="300" height="484" src="http://traditions.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/upload/3%28146%29.jpg" alt="" /></p>\r\n<p>Worship the moon at the Mid-Autumn Festival (Dai County, Shanxi)</p>\r\n<p align="center"><img width="400" height="383" src="http://traditions.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/upload/4%28107%29.jpg" alt="" /></p>\r\n<p>Floury flower to worship the moon at Mid-Autumn Festival - Photo by Qian Xiaoguang.</p>\r\n<p>From the ancient folk fables and unearthed articles, the sun is  always connected with a golden crow or a legendary Fusang tree; while  the moon is linked to the moon toad, the jade hare and the laurel. The  sun and the moon always move around the sky, rising from the east and  setting to the west. It reflects human''s basic knowledge of life and its  perpetuity. The moon toad and the medicine mortar are female symbols in  the family of the universe. The rabbit is god of proliferation; and the  Fusang, the laurel and the Sal are the tree of life. Together, those  symbols and images made up a fairy tale that has been told and passed  down for thousands of years. Obviously, moon worship is the main theme  of folk art works on the Mid- Autumn Festival.</p>\r\n<p>China is a multi-ethnic nation. Each nationality and every  geographical region has its own custom festivities. Miao ethnic group  worships ancestors by thumping cows; Yi and Bai ethnic groups have the  Torch Festival; others like the &quot;King''s day&quot; of Yao ethnic group;  &quot;Zangli New Year (lunar calendar used by Tibetan ethnic group);&quot;  &quot;Aobaojie&quot; in Inner Mongolia; and Paiwan ethnic group''s celebration of  harvest in Taiwan, etc. It is through this array of festivals that folk  art is seeded, grown and blossomed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Source:&nbsp; <a href="http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/17Traditions9285.html" target="_blank">http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/17Traditions9285.html</a></p>', 5, '', '2011-10-30 19:55:05'),

(11, 1, 'China, the Homeland of Tea ', '<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">\r\n<p>China is the homeland of tea. It is believed that China has tea-shrubs  as early as five to six thousand years ago, and human cultivation of  teaplants dates back two thousand years. Tea from China, along with her  silk and porcelain, began to be known the world over more than a  thousand years ago and has since always been an important Chinese  export. At present more than forty countries in the world grow tea with  Asian countries producing 90% of the world''s total output. All tea trees  in other countries have their origin directly or indirectly in China.  The word for tea leaves or tea as a drink in many countries  are  derivatives from the Chinese character &quot;<i>cha</i>.&quot; The Russians call it &quot;<i>cha''i</i>&quot;, which sounds like &quot;<i>chaye</i>&quot;  (tea leaves) as it is pronounced in northern China, and the English  word &quot;tea&quot; sounds similar to the pronunciation of its counterpart in   Xiamen (Amoy). The Japanese character for tea is written exactly  the  same as it is in Chinese, though pronounced with a slight difference.  The habit of tea drinking spread to Japan in the 6th century, but it was  not introduced to Europe and America  till the 17th and 18th centuries.  Now the number of tea drinkers in the world is legion and is still on  the increase.</p>\r\n<p><font size="5" color="#804000"><b>The Categories of Tea</b></font></p>\r\n<p>Chinese tea may be classified into five categories according to the different methods by which it is <img width="144" height="120" border="0" align="RIGHT" alt="tea" src="http://www.chinavista.com/experience/tea/tea.gif" />processed.</p>\r\n<p>1) <b>Green tea:</b> Green tea is the variety which keeps the original   colour of the tea leaves without fermentation during processing.  This  category consists mainly of <i>Longjing </i>tea of Zhejiang Province, <i>Maofeng</i> of Huangshan Mountain in Anhui Province and Biluochun produced in Jiangsu.</p>\r\n<p>2) <b>Black tea:</b> Black tea, known as &quot;red tea&quot; (<i>hong cha</i>)  in China, is the category which is fermented before baking; it is a  later variety developed on the basis of the green tea. The best brands  of black tea are <i>Qihong</i> of Anhui , <i>Dianhong</i> of Yunnan,    <i>Suhong</i> of Jiangsu, <i>Chuanhong</i> of Sichuan and <i>Huhong</i> of Hunan.</p>\r\n<p>3) <b>Wulong tea:</b> This represents a variety half way between the  green and the black teas, being made after partial fermentation.  It is a  specialty from the provinces on China''s southeast coast: Fujian,  Guangdong and Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>4) <b>Compressed tea:</b> This is the kind of tea which is compressed   and hardened into a certain shape. It is good for transport  and  storage and is mainly supplied to the ethnic minorities living in the  border areas of the country. As compressed tea is black in colour in its  commercial form, so it is also known in China as &quot;black tea&quot;. Most of  the compressed tea is in the form   of bricks; it is, therefore, generally called &quot;brick tea&quot;, though it  is sometimes also in the form of cakes and bowls. It is mainly produced  in Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>\r\n<p>5) <b>Scented tea:</b> This kind of tea is made by mixing fragrant  flowers in the tea leaves in the course of processing. The flowers   commonly used for this purpose are jasmine and magnolia among others.  Jasmine tea is a well-known favourite with the northerners of China and  with a growing number of foreigners.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><font size="5" color="#804000"><b>Tea Production</b></font></p>\r\n<p>A new tea-plant must grow for five years before its leaves   can be picked and, at 30 years of age, it will be too old to be  productive. The trunk of the old plant must then be cut off to force new  stems to grow out of the roots in the coming year. By repeated  rehabilitation in this way, a plant may serve for about l00 years .</p>\r\n<p>For the fertilization of tea gardens, soya-bean cakes or other   varieties of organic manure are generally used, and seldom chemical  fertilizers. When pests are discovered, the affected plants will be  removed to prevent their spread, and also to avoid the use of  pesticides.</p>\r\n<p>The season of tea-picking depends on local climate and   varies from area to area. On the shores of West Lake in   Hangzhou, where the famous green tea <i>Longjing</i> (Dragon Well)  comes from, picking starts from the end of March and lasts through  October, altogether 20-30 times from the same plants at intervals of  seven to ten days. With a longer interval, the quality of the tea will  deteriorate.</p>\r\n<p>A skilled woman picker can only gather 600 grams (a little   over a pound) of green tea leaves in a day.</p>\r\n<p>The new leaves must be parched in tea cauldrons. This   work , which used to be done manually, has been largely mechanized.  Top-grade <i>Dragon Well</i>  tea, however, still has to be stir-parched by hand, doing only 250  grams every half hour. The tea-cauldrons are heated electrically to a  temperature of about 25<sup>o</sup>C or 74<sup>o</sup>F. It takes four pounds of fresh leaves to produce one pound of parched tea.</p>\r\n<p>The best <i>Dragon Well</i> tea is gathered several days before <i>Qingming</i>  (Pure Brightness, 5th solar term) when new twigs have just begun to  grow and carry &quot;one leaf and a bud.&quot; To make one kilogram (2.2 lbs) of  finished tea, 60, 000 tender leaves have to be plucked. In the old days <i>Dragon Well</i> tea of this grade was meant solely for the imperial household; it was, therefore, known as &quot;tribute tea&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>For the processes of grinding, parching, rolling, shaping   and drying other grades of tea various machines have been developed   and built, turning out about 100 kilograms of finished tea an hour and  relieving the workers from much of their drudgery.</p>\r\n<p><img width="219" height="146" border="0" align="left" alt="a ceramic teapot" src="http://www.chinavista.com/experience/tea/teapot1.jpg" />   <font size="5" color="#804000"><b>China''s Tea-Producing Areas</b></font></p>\r\n<p>Tea is produced in vast areas of China from Hainan lsland   down in the extreme south to Shandong Province in the north, from  Tibet in the southwest to Taiwan across the Straits, totalling more than  20 provinces. These may be divided into four major areas:</p>\r\n<p>1) <b>The Jiangnan area:</b> It lies south of the middle and lower  reaches of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River, and is the most prolific of  China''s tea-growing areas. Most of its output is the green variety; some  black tea is also produced.</p>\r\n<p>2) <b>The Jiangbei area:</b> This refers to a large area north of the  same river, where the average temperature is 2-3 Centigrade  degrees  lower than in the Jiangnan area. Green tea is the principal variety  turned out there, but Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, which are also parts  of this area. produce compressed tea for supply to the minority areas in  the Northwest.</p>\r\n<p>3) <b>The Southwest area:</b> This embraces Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou and Tibet, producing black, green as well as compressed  teas. <i>Pu''er</i> tea of Yunnan Province enjoys a good sale in China and abroad.</p>\r\n<p>4) <b>The Lingnan area:</b> This area , consisting of the southern provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian and taiwan, produces <i>Wulong</i> tea, which is renowned both at home and abroad.</p>\r\n<p><font size="5" color="#804000"><b>Advantages of Tea-Drinking</b></font></p>\r\n<p>Tea has been one of the daily necessities in China since time  immemorial. Countless numbers of people like to have their aftermeal cup  of tea.</p>\r\n<p>In summer or warm climate, tea seems to dispel the heat   and bring on instant cool together with a feeling of relaxation. For  this reason, tea-houses abound in towns and market villages in South  China and provide elderly retirees with the locales to meet and chat  over a cup of tea.</p>\r\n<p>Medically, the tea leaf contains a number of chemicals, of   which 20-30% is tannic acid, known for its anti-inflammatory and  germicidal properties. It also contains an alkaloid (5%, mainly  caffeine), a stimulant for the nerve centre and the process  of  metabolism. Tea with the aromatics in it may help resolve  meat and fat  and thus promote digestion. It is, therefore, of special importance to  people who live mainly on meat, like many of the ethnic minorities in  China. A popular proverb among them says, &quot;Rather go without salt for  three days than without tea for a single day.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Tea is also rich in various vitamins and, for smokers, it   helps to discharge nicotine out of the system. After wining, strong tea may prove to be a sobering pick-me-up.</p>\r\n<p>The above, however, does not go to say that the stronger   the tea, the more advantages it will yield. Too much tannic acid will  affect the secretion of the gastric juice, irritate the membrane of the  stomach and cause indigestion or constipation. Strong tea taken just  before bedtime will give rise to occasional insomnia. Constant drinking  of over-strong tea may induce heart and blood-pressure disorders in some  people, reduce the milk of a breast-feeding mother, and put a brown  colour on the teeth of young people. But it is not difficult to ward off  these undesirable effects: just don''t make your tea too strong.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Source:&nbsp; http://www.chinavista.com/experience/tea/tea.html</p>\r\n</font></p>', 0, '', '2011-11-02 09:16:13'),

Instead, they mainly offer selections from all over Southeast  Asia with some American and European selections sprinkled in. For  Italian, they offer Barilla brand penne rigate, farfalle, conchiglie  rigate and spaghetti pastas for 19 RMB a box.</p>\r\n<p>The packaged meats and cheese section are pretty standard fare,  offering Maverick brand American style bacon and ham for 22 RMB and 6  RMB for a pack respectively. The cheese section offers Kraft Singles at  32 RMB per 12-pack. For a more exotic cheese, you can try the Lemnos  brand Black Forest Ham wheel for 34 RMB.<br />\r\nThe &ldquo;gem&rdquo; of Vanguard must be its chocolate section, which at more than 5  metres wide and 2 metres tall, houses just about every internationally  popular chocolate brand out there for reasonable prices.</p>\r\n<p>Add: 1019 South Yingbin Lu, Gongbei, Xiangzhou District, Zhuhai<br />\r\n地址: 珠海香洲区拱北迎宾南路1019号 <br />\r\nTel: 0756 828 1234<br />\r\nOpening hours: 09:00-22:00</p>\r\n<p><strong>2) </strong><strong>JUSCO</strong><br />\r\nJUSCO is probably Zhuhai&rsquo;s most well known supermarket amongst expats.  Situated in Zhuhai&rsquo;s Xiangzhou District, a popular area for expats,  JUSCO provides many foreigners with easy access to imported foods.  Rivaling the size of the aforementioned Vanguard, JUSCO provides a large  selection of groceries but with more of an international flare since it  is Japanese owned.</p>\r\n<p>The one thing that sticks out when browsing the aisles of JUSCO is  the fresh meats section. Offering fresh beefsteaks and fillets from USA,  New Zealand and Japan, JUSCO provides Zhuhai&rsquo;s denizens with the widest  variety of imported fresh beef available. You will, however, have to  pay a premium for the imported beef at 30 RMB for 200 grams at the low  end and upwards of 40 RMB for just 100 grams at the high end. For some,  the mouthwatering appeal of having a steak from home can outweigh the  costs.</p>\r\n<p>JUSCO&rsquo;s drink section is also a cornucopia of options, housing  various coffees, teas, juices, wines, liquors and beers from all over  the world. Stickers with the country of origin&rsquo;s flag next to the  products makes browsing for your &ldquo;cup of tea&rdquo; as simple as opening your  eyes. Starbuck&rsquo;s Frappacinos are available at 24 RMB a bottle and if  your feeling a little constipated, you can grab a bottle of New Zealand  organic prune juice for a whopping 178 RMB. Fresh milk is also available  from Germany and New Zealand.</p>\r\n<p>Add: 1088 Fenghuang Nanlu, Xiangzhou District, Zhuhai<br />\r\n地址: 珠海香洲区凤凰南路1088号 <br />\r\nTel: 0756 222 2988<br />\r\nOpening hours: 09:00-22:00</p>\r\n<p align="center"><img width="381" height="323" alt="Best Places to Buy Imported Food in Zhuhai" src="http://www.echinacities.com/userfiles/2011-Year/9-Month/6-Day/image004-.jpg" /><br />\r\nPhoto: <a target="_blank" href="http://deltabridges.com/promotion/zhuhai-vip-promotions/zhuhai-deli-special-discount-zhuhai">deltabridges</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>3) </strong><strong>Zhuhai Deli</strong><br />\r\nWith every Goliath there is a David and just like the David in the old  story, this haunt may be small but it is a force to be reckoned with.  Located near Zhuhai&rsquo;s famed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.echinacities.com/zhuhai/city-guide/entertainment/zhuhai-entertainment.html">Bar Street</a>  (Jiuba Jie), Zhuhai Deli could be considered Zhuhai&rsquo;s most well known  secret amongst expats. Its size makes it difficult to find but once you  do, you will be hard pressed to get it out of your mind.</p>\r\n<p>The most striking thing about Zhuhai Deli is the sheer absence of  Chinese characters on the products. Unlike the previously mentioned  Vanguard and JUSCO, Zhuhai Deli does not have a dedicated imported foods  section, because almost every product offered here has been small-batch  imported directly from its country of origin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For meats, they offer US Angus beef, Canadian beef and New Zealand  beef rib eyes at 30, 20 and 14 RMB per 100 grams respectively. Various  sausages are offered from Italy and Germany at around 10 RMB for 100  grams. Even Norwegian salmon fillets are available at 35 RMB for 100  grams. If you&rsquo;re a hamburger lover, you can even buy ground beef,  chicken and pork.</p>\r\n<p>What would a deli be without deli sliced meats and cheeses.&nbsp; For  those Americans out there, Butterball brand turkey should ring a bell.&nbsp;  Also six different Italian salamis are offered.&nbsp; Cheeses include Gouda,  cream, Swiss, cheddar, mozzarella and blue all sliced deli style.</p>\r\n<p>For non-perishables, Zhuhai Deli offers Spanish olives, baked beans,  Dijon mustards, jalape&ntilde;os, salsa, queso, macaroni and cheese, tuna,  sardines, turkey, dill pickles, marinara sauce, salad dressings and soup  all from the brands you&rsquo;ve come to know.</p>\r\n<p>I could probably have spent this entire article on what Zhuhai Deli  has to offer but if there is one thing to take away, it is that Zhuhai  Deli may be a small package compared with the Vanguards and JUSCOs, but  it packs quite a punch.</p>\r\n<p>Add: 1 / Flat 101#,Yuhaiwan Garden, 213 Shuiwan Tou, Jida, Zhuhai <br />\r\n地址: 珠海水湾头御海湾花园首层101号铺 <br />\r\nTel: 075 6818 9979 <br />\r\nOpening hours: 10:00-21:00<br />\r\nEmail: <a href="mailto:zhuhaideli@126.com">zhuhaideli@126.com</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>source: http://www.echinacities.com/zhuhai/city-life/best-places-to-buy-imported-food-in-zhuhai.html</p>', 14, '', '2011-11-01 12:09:47'),

Now, some have begun selling that  valuable information to the highest bidder.</p>\r\n<p>In mid-October,  Verizon Wireless changed its privacy policy to allow the company to  record customers'' location data and Web browsing history, combine it  with other personal information like age and gender, aggregate it with  millions of other customers'' data, and sell it on an anonymous basis.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/15/technology/schmidt_mwc/index.htm?iid=EL">That kind of data could be very useful</a>  -- and lucrative -- to third-party companies. For instance, if a small  business owner wanted to figure out the best place to open a new pet  store, the owner could buy a marketing report from Verizon about a  designated area. The report might reveal which city blocks get the most  foot or car traffic from people whose Web browsing history reveals that  they own pets.</p>\r\n<p>Verizon (<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=VZ&amp;source=story_quote_link">VZ</a></span>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2011/snapshots/2773.html?source=story_f500_link">Fortune 500</a>)  is the first mobile provider to publicly confirm that it is actually  selling information gleaned from its customers directly to businesses.  But it''s hardly alone in using data about its subscribers to make extra  cash.</p>\r\n<p>All four national carriers use aggregated customer  information to help outside parties target ads to their subscribers.  AT&amp;T, Sprint and T-Mobile insist that subscriber data is never  actually handed over to third-party vendors; nevertheless, they all make  money on it.</p>\r\n<p>AT&amp;T''s (<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=T&amp;source=story_quote_link">T</a></span>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2011/snapshots/2756.html?source=story_f500_link">Fortune 500</a>) AdWorks program, for instance, promotes AT&amp;T''s customer base to advertisers. On its  <a href="http://www.adworks.att.com/mobile/" target="new">AdWorks website</a>,  AT&amp;T touts its ability to &quot;reach customized audience segments based  on anonymous and aggregate demographics.&quot; It then shows customers  carefully tailored coupons, in-app ads and Web ads.</p>\r\n<p>Sprint (<span class="inlink_chart"><a class="inlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=S&amp;source=story_quote_link">S</a></span>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2011/snapshots/2015.html?source=story_f500_link">Fortune 500</a>),  like Verizon, tracks the kinds of websites a customer visits on their  mobile devices as well as what applications they use, according to  spokesman Jason Gertzen. Sprint uses that data to help third parties  target ads to customers.</p>\r\n<p>That''s a step further than Verizon goes.  It too lets advertisers target customized messages to Verizon  subscribers'' mobile phones, but for that initiative, it does <i>not</i>  incorporate its customers'' Web surfing or location data, according to a  company spokesman. Verizon relies on other personal information,  including customers'' demographic details and home address.</p>\r\n<p>T-Mobile declined to answer specific questions about what kind of information it shares or sells, instead pointing CNNMoney to <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/company/website/privacypolicy.aspx#fullpolicy" target="new">T-Mobile''s privacy policy</a>.  The policy''s open-ended terms seem to suggest that the company does not  divulge customer information, but a T-Mobile spokeswoman acknowledged  that the company &quot;collects information about the websites that customers  visit and their location&quot; and that it &quot;may use that information in an  anonymous, aggregate form to improve our services.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Selling  customer information is an age-old practice that is certainly not  exclusive to the wireless industry. Brian Kennish, a former DoubleClick  engineer who developed the advertising network''s mobile ad server, noted  that wireless companies have been sharing users'' location data with  third parties for more than a decade.</p>\r\n<h2><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/04/28/technology/iphone_location/index.htm?iid=EL">Why Apple and Google need to stalk you</a></h2>\r\n<p>But the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/10/12/technology/cellphones_outnumber_americans/index.htm?iid=EL">rise of smartphones</a>  has given mobile providers an accidental treasure trove of marketable  data: The gadgets are hyper-personalized tracking devices that &quot;know&quot;  more about their owners than any other product on the market.</p>\r\n<p>Wireless providers are taking advantage of their gold mine.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;At  the end of the day, we''re getting to a situation where customers are  the products that these wireless companies are selling,&quot; said Nasir  Memon, a professor of computer science at New York University''s  Polytechnic Institute. &quot;They''re creating a playground to attract people  and sell them to advertisers.

But with smartphone customer data in their arsenal, wireless carriers are well positioned to swoop in as well.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Verizon  revealed the industry''s strategy,&quot; said Jeff Chester, executive  director of the Center for Digital Democracy. &quot;This is more than the  camel''s nose under the tent.

But privacy advocates are concerned about the direction  wireless companies are headed.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;The Web pages we go to and  searches we do are the closest thing to our thoughts, the most private  info of all, that can be recorded,&quot; said Kennish, who now heads up <a href="http://disconnect.me/" target="new">Disconnect</a>,  an online privacy tool. &quot;If Verizon succeeds, I''m sure others will  follow.

The name means <i>Pearl Sea</i>; Zhuhai is where the Pearl River (珠江; <i>Zhūjiāng</i>) flows into the South Sea (南海 <i>N&aacute;nhǎi</i>).</p>\r\n<p>Zhuhai is known for its beautiful long coastline, waving palm  trees, open spaces, low population density, and its many islands;  Zhuhai''s nicknames are <i>the city for lovers</i> and <i>the city of a hundred islands</i>.  Zhuhai serves as the gateway to Macau, as a tourist destination for  Chinese, and as a playground for hedonistic Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan  visitors who come for Zhuhai''s very colorful nightlife and available <i>female companionship</i> at mainland prices.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Located in the <a title="Pearl River Delta" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Pearl_River_Delta" target="_blank">Pearl River Delta</a>, Zhuhai borders <a target="_blank" title="Jiangmen" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Jiangmen">Jiangmen</a> to the northwest, <a title="Zhongshan" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Zhongshan" target="_blank">Zhongshan</a> to the north, and former Portuguese colony <a title="Macau" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Macau">Macau</a> to the south.

The provincial capital <a title="Guangzhou" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Guangzhou" target="_blank">Guangzhou</a> is about 150 km to the north.</p>\r\n<p>The Zhuhai area has been inhabited for thousands of years. Until  the 1970s, Zhuhai was a group of fishing villages with a population of  around 100,000. Since 1980, when it was designated a Special Economic  Zone by the central government, Zhuhai has expanded to include nearby  areas and is now a fast-growing modern city with well over a million  inhabitants.  However, it is still not as large and developed as  neighboring cities like <a target="_blank" title="Shenzhen" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Shenzhen">Shenzhen</a> and <a target="_blank" title="Guangzhou" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>.  Zhuhai''s northern districts of Jinding and Tangjia, as well as the  western district of Doumen, are less developed factory-driven areas that  retain a deeper working-man, salt-of-the-earth quality.</p>\r\n<p>Zhuhai is one of China''s cleanest and prettiest cities, and  received numerous accolades for its excellent ecological development  efforts. In 1998, it was awarded the <i>International Award for Best Practices in Improving Living Environment</i>  by the United Nations Center for Human Settlements. It is also commonly  agreed to be one of the best cities in China to retire in. With a low  population density compared to other larger cities in China, Zhuhai is  unsurprisingly greener. Parks and open spaces dot the cityscape, and  waving palm trees line the extensive coastline and many of the major  streets.</p>\r\n<p>The weather in Zhuhai is sub-tropical. Temperature varies between  10C/50F degrees in winter (Dec to Feb) to a hot and humid 35C/95F  degrees in summer (Jun to Sep). Typhoons are also a possibility in  summer. The best times to visit are during spring and fall.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span class="mw-headline">Districts</span></h2>\r\n<p><b>Jinding</b> (金鼎; <i>Jīndǐng</i>) &ndash; Zhuhai''s northernmost district is a  factory town whose main attraction is a very large and lively nighttime  outdoor BBQ; see the <a title="" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Zhuhai#Eat">Eat</a> Section for details. Jinding definitely has a <i>working class edge</i>,  and is worth visiting for the BBQ alone, but wandering around may give  you a different perspective to the ones you have previously experienced  elsewhere in Guangdong Province. Visit Jinding to experience the <i>real China</i>  before heading back to your more affluent Guangdong stomping grounds.  Jinding can be reached via bus 3 or 10, or via sightseeing bus 2.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><b>Tangjiawan</b> (唐家湾; <i>T&aacute;ngjiāwān</i>) &ndash; Tangjia is moderate sized  town located between Jinding and Xiangzhou. Like Jinding, Tangjia''s  salt-of-the-earth qualities are more evident than its southern  neighbors. Best known for the large <b>Dragon Union Opera House</b>  which, as the name suggests, puts on live variety shows semi-regularly,  its primary function is serving as a gigantic karaoke house that mixes  karaoke with <i>all-inclusive</i> adult entertainment.

Each trip is a noticeable escape  from the hustle and bustle of living in Chinese cities. A trip to the  islands is arguably comparable to leaving the country. High-quality  seafood abounds. Information about where to go or what to do can be  difficult to come by because most locals do not visit due to cost of  transportation. As a result, most tourists do not get a chance to  explore these beautiful places at all, and most of the information  available on the internet regarding Zhuhai focuses on the urban areas.  Nonetheless, the curious expat or adventurous traveler will be  generously rewarded.

(15, 1, 'Why do you lost hair. Get the reasons here.', '<p>Due to hormonal changes, irritation or damage, some hair follicles have a shorter growth phase and produce thinner, shorter hair shafts. Your hair goes through a cycle of growth and rest. The course of each cycle varies by individual. But in general, the growth phase of scalp hair, known as anagen, typically lasts two to three years. During this time, your hair grows just less than 1/2 inch (1 centimeter) a month. The resting phase is called telogen. This phase typically lasts three to four months. At the end of the resting phase, the hair strand falls out and a new one begins to grow in its place. Once a hair is shed, the growth stage begins again.</p>\r\n<p>Most people normally shed 50 to 100 hairs a day. But with about 100,000 hairs in the scalp, this amount of hair loss shouldn''t cause noticeable thinning of the scalp hair.</p>\r\n<p>Gradual thinning is a normal part of aging. However, hair loss may lead to baldness when the rate of shedding exceeds the rate of regrowth, when new hair is thinner than the hair shed or when hair comes out in patches.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Causes of specific types of hair loss</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia). </strong>In male- and female-pattern baldness, the time of growth shortens, and the hairs are not as thick or sturdy. With each growth cycle, the hairs become rooted more superficially and more easily fall out. Heredity likely plays a key role. A history of androgenetic alopecia on either side of your family increases your risk of balding. Heredity also affects the age at which you begin to lose hair and the developmental speed, pattern and extent of your baldness.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Cicatricial (scarring) alopecia. </strong>This type of permanent hair loss occurs when inflammation damages and scars the hair follicle. This prevents new hair from growing. This condition can be seen in several skin conditions, including lupus erythematosus or lichen planus. It''s not known what triggers or causes this inflammation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Alopecia areata. </strong>This is classified as an autoimmune disease, but the cause is unknown. People who develop alopecia areata are generally in good health. A few people may have other autoimmune disorders, including thyroid disease. Some scientists believe that some people are genetically predisposed to develop alopecia areata and that a trigger, such as a virus or something else in the environment, sets off the condition. A family history of alopecia areata makes you more likely to develop it. With alopecia areata, your hair generally grows back, but you may lose and regrow your hair a number of times.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Telogen effluvium. </strong>This type of hair loss is usually due to a change in your normal hair cycle. It may occur when some type of shock to your system &mdash; emotional or physical &mdash; causes hair roots to be pushed prematurely into the resting state. The affected growing hairs from these hair roots fall out. In a month or two, the hair follicles become active again and new hair starts to grow. Telogen effluvium may follow emotional distress, such as a death in the family or a physiological stress, such as a high fever, sudden or excessive weight loss, extreme diets, nutritional deficiencies, surgery, or metabolic disturbances. Hair typically grows back once the condition that caused it corrects itself, but it usually take months.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Traction alopecia.</strong> Excessive hairstyling or hairstyles that pull your hair too tightly cause traction alopecia. If the pulling is stopped before there''s scarring of your scalp and permanent damage to the root, hair usually grows back normally.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other causes of hair loss</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Poor nutrition.</strong> Having inadequate protein or iron in your diet or poor nourishment in other ways can cause you to experience hair loss. Fad diets, crash diets and certain illnesses, such as eating disorders, can cause poor nutrition.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Medications. </strong>Certain drugs used to treat gout, arthritis, depression, heart problems and high blood pressure may cause hair loss in some people. Taking birth control pills also may result in hair loss for some women.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Disease. </strong>Diabetes and lupus can cause hair loss.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Medical treatments. </strong>Undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy may cause you to develop alopecia. Under these conditions, healthy, growing (anagen) hairs can be affected. After your treatment ends, your hair typically begins to regrow.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Hormonal changes. </strong>Hormonal changes and imbalances can cause temporary hair loss. This could be due to pregnancy, childbirth, discontinuation of birth control pills, the onset of menopause, or an overactive or underactive thyroid gland. The hair loss may be delayed by three months following a hormonal change, and it''ll take another three months for new hair to grow back. During pregnancy, it''s normal to have thicker, more luxuriant hair. It''s also common to lose more hair than normal about three months after delivery. If a hormonal imbalance is associated with an overproduction of testosterone, there may be a thinning of hair over the crown of the scalp. Correcting hormonal imbalances may stop hair loss.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Hair treatments.</strong> Chemicals used for dying, tinting, bleaching, straightening or permanent waves can cause hair to become damaged and break off if they are overused or used incorrectly. Overstyling and excessive brushing also can cause hair to fall out if the hair shaft becomes damaged.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Scalp infection.</strong> Infections, such as ringworm, can invade the hair and skin of your scalp, leading to hair loss. Once infections are treated, hair generally grows back. Ringworm, a fungal infection, can usually be treated with a topical or oral antifungal medication.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder). </strong>Trichotillomania is a type of mental illness in which people have an irresistible urge to pull out their hair, whether it''s from the scalp, their eyebrows or other areas of the body. Hair pulling from the scalp often leaves them with patchy bald spots on the head, which they may go to great lengths to disguise. Causes of trichotillomania are still being researched, and no specific cause has yet been found.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Source:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hair-loss/DS00278/DSECTION=causes" target="_blank">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hair-loss/DS00278/DSECTION=causes</a></p>', 0, '', '2011-11-03 11:14:34'),

Local people called the drains in paddy  fields &quot;zhen&quot; or &quot;chong&quot;. The name &quot;Shenzhen&quot; means &quot;deep drains&quot;,  because this is an area crisscrossed with rivers and streams, and there  are deep drains in the paddy fields. Shenzhen became a township at the  beginning of the Qing Dynasty. Shenzhen is also known as &quot;Roc City.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Ancient Baiyue Tribe (Prehistory -214 B.C.)</p>\r\n<p>In  the Xia and Shang dynasties, Shenzhen was a base for the ancient  sea-faring Baiyue Tribe. Those who lived here were called the Nanyue  Tribe, a southern branch of the Baiyue Tribe. They lived mainly by  fishing with little land cultivation.</p>\r\n<p>Qin Prefecture (214 B.C-331)</p>\r\n<p>After  Qinshihuang united China to become its first emperor, he set up, in 214  B.C., three prefectures--Nanhai, Guilin and Xiangjun--in the area  encompassing Guangdong and Guangxi. He banished 500,000 people from  central China to the southern areas to help development. Shenzhen was  under the administration of Nanhai Prefecture at the time and was  formally brought into China''s territory at that time.</p>\r\n<p>Establishment of County (331-1573)</p>\r\n<p>Shenzhen  City historically derives from Bao''an County. In 331, in the Eastern  Jin Dynasty, Dongguan Prefecture was established to administer the  six-county area that now covers Shenzhen, Dongguan and Hong Kong. The  capital of the prefecture was located in Nantou, Bao''an County.During  the Song Dynasty, Shenzhen became an important hub for maritime trade in  South China. It was also famous for its salt and spices. In the Yuan  Dynasty, pearls were another famous product of the area. In 1394 of the  Ming Dynasty, Dongguan and Dapeng military bases were set up in the  Shenzhen area. With a history going back more than 600 years, Nantou  Ancient City was once a political center in the Shenzhen, Hong Kong and  Macao area in the Qing Dynasty.</p>\r\n<p>Xin''an Ancient Town (1573-1841)</p>\r\n<p>Shenzhen  was also called Xin''an County in times gone by. In 1573, a new county  named Xin''an was established in the territory of today''s Shenzhen and  Hong Kong. This was accomplished by enlarging the Dongguan Military  Base, with the county seat located in Nantou. Salt, tea, spices and rice  were the backbone of the new county''s economy.</p>\r\n<p>Cession of the Territory (1842-1898)</p>\r\n<p>The  Treaty of Nanjing, which was a treaty agreed upon by China and Britain,  was signed on July 24, 1842. Hong Kong Island was occupied by the  British. On Jan.11, 1860, the Kowloon Peninsula was ceded to the British  under The Convention of Peking and on April 21, 1898, another treaty  led the Qing Dynasty Government to lease the New Territories to Britain  for 99 years. From that point on, 1,055.6 square kilometers were  separated from the total 3,076 square kilometers of Xin''an County. Name  Resumption (1913-1979)In 1913, Xin''an County resumed the name of Bao''an  County with the county seat remaining in Nantou.</p>\r\n<p>County Transfer  (1938-1953)During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression,  Nantou was occupied by Japanese troops and so the county government  temporarily moved to Dongguan County. In 1953, the Bao''an county seat  moved eastward to Shenzhen Township, 10 kilometers from Nantou. As the  Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway ran through Shenzhen, more people lived there  and industry and commerce prospered.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Source:&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tourochina.com/guide/Shenzhen/overview-532.html">http://www.tourochina.com/guide/Shenzhen/overview-532.html</a></p>\r\n</div>', 0, '', '2011-11-03 13:12:52'),

(18, 1, 'The biggest potatoes markets in China''s Inner Mongolia', '<p>Separated by 600 miles of mountain roads and part of the Great Wall  of China, much stands between the buzzing supermarkets of 21st century  Beijing and Wuchuan County, Inner Mongolia, with its patchwork of  family-owned potato plots. In China, as in other rapidly developing  countries, seemingly impossible differences in scale, power, and culture  have opened up between rural farming and urban marketing. As large  supermarkets belonging to even larger national and international chains  have come to sell much of the food consumed in cities, much of the  produce is still grown by smallholder farmers cultivating tiny plots of  land in remote regions. Here in Inner Mongolia, at least, the farmers  have found new cooperative solutions to accessing Beijing''s supermarket  shelves on a more equal footing.</p>\r\n<h3>Potato country</h3>\r\n<p>The farmers of Wuchuan County, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous  Region forming the border of north-west China, began growing potatoes  early in the 20th century and found that their cold, highland valleys  produced a crop of exceptional quality. The era of farm collectivisation  came and went, and the farmers returned to cultivating small land  holdings, often less than a hectare, while selling to regional traders  at markets or on the roadside. Starting in the 1990s, these local buyers  became the beginning of a long chain of middlemen, which might carry  the harvest to the booming capital city of Beijing. Here the first  modern supermarket opened in 1994, and by 2008 - with more than half a  million chain supermarkets operating nationwide - the businesses were  selling some 90 per cent of agricultural food products in the capital.</p>\r\n<div class="picBox" style="width:220px"><img alt="" src="/web/article/foc1057_1.jpg" /><br />\r\n<div class="caption">With help from the SFAGM project, the new cooperative has instituted more precise hand-sorting for quality control<br />\r\n<em>Dr. Hu Dinghuan</em></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>While  some products of Inner Mongolia''s highlands found their way into  Beijing shopping carts, it was the middlemen rather than the farmers who  reaped the benefits of urban affluence. The supply chains needed  shortening. In 2003, motivated by the country''s recent accession to the  WTO, the Chinese and Canadian governments initiated the Small Farmers  Adapting to Global Markets (SFAGM) project in China''s western provinces.  Wuchuan County was selected as a pilot region, and a research team  began surveying both the county and Beijing''s supermarkets to gauge the  potential for new links.</p>\r\n<h3>Crossing the mountains</h3>\r\n<p>One early entrepreneur, Ms. Wu Qiong, travelled with the survey group  who visited Beijing. Afterwards in 2005, she signed an agreement with  Wu-Mart Supermarket to supply potatoes from her home region. She put her  personal finances into two tons of her neighbours'' potatoes and a truck  to transport them over the Yinshan Mountains. She and the driver had to  unload the truck themselves at the distribution centre in the city, but  even with this do-it-yourself approach, Wu Qiong could not recoup the  cost of transport. She decided not to continue this one-woman trade.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, cooperation and organisation enabled farmers to deal with  supermarkets collectively rather than as individuals. With help from the  SFAGM project the new cooperative instituted more precise hand-sorting  for quality control, designed packaging printed with the Chuanbao brand  (meaning ''Wuchuan''s treasure''), and forged contracts to send larger  shipments to Beijing buyers. The recognisable brand began to make a name  for Wuchuan potatoes.</p>\r\n<h3>New customers</h3>\r\n<div class="picBoxLft" style="width:220px"><img width="220" height="166" alt="" src="/web/article/foc1057_2.jpg" /><br />\r\n<div class="caption">Cooperation and organisation has enabled farmers to deal with supermarkets collectively, rather than as individuals<br />\r\n<em>Dr. Hu Dinghuan</em></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>While  the SFAGM researchers experimented with many approaches to increase the  marketability of the region''s potatoes - good agricultural practices,  improved extension methods, on-farm quality and food safety assurance -  there has, interestingly, been little need for change in farming methods  or in the potatoes themselves. Established methods, using animal manure  as the only significant input, are well suited to the environment and  the favoured potato varieties already appeal to consumers. In fact, the  under-development of Inner Mongolia proved an asset, providing one of  the least polluted environments in the country for growing the safe and  organic produce that sophisticated urbanites have begun to seek out. The  only missing link was, indeed, that between farmers and ready markets.  Three years after Ms. Wu Qiong''s first sale, Wuchuan potatoes gained  such a reputation for purity that the Beijing municipal government  sought out the cooperative to supply the 2008 Olympic Games.</p>\r\n<p>The SFAGM project has now ended, but the links with Beijing have  grown in new directions, reports head researcher Dr. Hu Dinghuan of the  Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. In a recent  turnaround, he says, &quot;Chinese supermarkets have started a new  procurement system: they go directly to agri-food product areas and buy  directly from farmers or farmer cooperatives. In Wuchan, the supermarket  Carrefour buys many potatoes from several potato cooperatives.&quot; The  French-owned Carrefour is the second largest retail chain in the world  in profit terms, but Wuchuan''s cooperatives, already organised to sell,  have been able to negotiate well with the buyer on their home ground.  Their success has proven that, with a little cooperation, even the  smallest of smallholders can cut deals with the largest supermarket  chains.</p>\r\n<p>Written by: T.

There are a fair number  of adults who had been born here, but you are far more likely to meet  those from Hunan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Henan, Hubei, northern China and  Cantonese from other parts of Guangdong. This appeals because the city  has become more receptive and friendly towards foreigners, too.<br />\r\nOur family lived just outside Shiqiao of Dongguan in the 1990s, and that  had a different feeling. As for the Pearl River Delta, picture  integrating as a family into Jiangmen, Kaiping, or Sihui cultures with  their multi-generational relationships. It&rsquo;s quite difficult. Zhuhai is  where people migrate to stay.<br />\r\nGuangzhou is still polluted and overpowering. Dongguan and Shenzhen  are fair candidates also populated by domestic immigrants. Both have  evolved over the last ten years and are nicer to live in. Both have  western amenities, restaurants, schools and large western populations.</p>\r\n<p>Zhuhai first<br />\r\nBut this is where objectivity flies out the window &ndash; I prefer Zhuhai.  Neither Guangzhou nor Dongguan is situated on the ocean; is as  beautiful, laid back or comfortable. And neither is so easily accessible  to Macao and arguably Hong Kong.<br />\r\nXiamen is clean and beautiful too. It&rsquo;s relatively inconvenient, but  the commuter train and new highways will quash that argument. Within a  year there will be a speed rail from Shenzhen, running to Xiamen and  connecting through Fujian and on to Shanghai, Hangzhou and beyond.<br />\r\nComparisons aside, quite a few of us in Zhuhai are content for others  to stay where they are. We, on the relaxed side of the Pearl River  Delta, like it that way. Recent &ldquo;progress&rdquo; is a little disconcerting,  however.</p>\r\n<p>Progress?<br />\r\nThe Gongbei station for the Qing Gui railroad is almost complete, but  who wants to go to Shunde anyway? And this bridge to Hong Kong &ndash; there  goes the neighbourhood.<br />\r\nThe prerequisite is you need to love to be in China. We&rsquo;ve been in the  region over 20 years and in Zhuhai for more than ten. We feel  privileged to be part of this community and to have witnessed and  participated in changes and growth. Our children were born and raised  here. Their education and worldview has roots in this city with the  influences of Chinese and western teachers and friends.<br />\r\nWhat other locale has an Italian restaurant run by a man from Ningbo  who makes food that rivals restaurants around the world? Where else can  one start a company supported by the city administration and  infrastructure?<br />\r\nIn the next decade Zhuhai will have many residents who have grown up  here. Our confluence of friends, acquaintances and inspirations  worldwide has commonality in this Pearl on the Ocean.<br />\r\nThis, are the journalists listening? -- is why we love this place.<br />\r\n(American Don Thayer and family are decade-long residents of Zhuhai. He is in the shoe industry.)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href="http://deltabridges.com/news/zhuhai-news/it%E2%80%99s-privilege-live-zhuhai-don-thayer" target="_blank">http://deltabridges.com/news/zhuhai-news/it%E2%80%99s-privilege-live-zhuhai-don-thayer</a></p>', 0, '', '2011-11-06 09:20:19'),

(25, 1, 'China could be harder than USA on 2012 crisis', '<p><strong>Crisis of 2012 May Be Harder on China Than U.S.: William Pesek</strong></p>\r\n<p>ct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Economists were probably too busy watching  markets gyrate to contemplate last month&rsquo;s big news in science.  Physicists detected particles travelling faster than light, which, if  the reading was accurate, means time travel is possible.</p>\r\n<p class="indent">Now, let&rsquo;s play a quick mind experiment that  would surely captivate the deans of the dismal science: Pretend you have  just been transported 10 years into the future to see how this  incipient global crisis pans out. It would be hard to find anyone who  isn&rsquo;t desperate to know.</p>\r\n<p class="indent">What if, a decade from now, the U.S. comes out the winner of today&rsquo;s market chaos at the expense of Europe and China?</p>\r\n<p class="indent">This intriguing contrarian view is the subject of  &ldquo;The American Phoenix,&rdquo; a new book by Hong Kong-based economist Diana  Choyleva and her Lombard Street Research colleague Charles Dumas.  Bargain bins are loaded with China-crash titles. What&rsquo;s different about  this book is that it turns all we think we know about the interplay  between the Group of Two on its head.</p>\r\n<p class="indent">If the last few years taught us anything, it&rsquo;s  that the unthinkable has an uncanny knack of happening. From Arab Spring  protests to China bailing out Europe&rsquo;s markets to a U.S. presidential  candidate suggesting it&rsquo;s treasonous for the Federal Reserve to do its  job, the world really is upside down.</p>\r\n<p class="indent">So it&rsquo;s worth considering an alternative  trajectory for the U.S. and China as another meltdown seems to be  unfolding. It&rsquo;s hard to be optimistic for 2012 as Europe dithers,  Washington bickers, Japan&rsquo;s paralysis deepens and China experiments with  ways to avoid overheating.</p>\r\n<p class="center">G-2 World</p>\r\n<p class="indent">If there is an accepted narrative about the G-2  in Asia, it goes something like this: China will grow 8 percent or 9  percent a year indefinitely, grabbing global market share as it moves  from sweatshops to a knowledge-based, innovation-driven model. Hiccups  may happen, but China will surpass the U.S. economy 10 or 20 years from  now.</p>\r\n<p class="indent">The U.S., meanwhile, experiences a slow, steady  slide as the magnitude of its challenges overwhelms a political system  ridden with gridlock, an excessive debt load and chronic joblessness.  The reason Occupy Wall Street went global in ways the Tea Party didn&rsquo;t  is that the former reflects the reasons for America&rsquo;s decline, while the  latter is mere handwringing over it.</p>\r\n<p class="indent">The question is whether the U.S. recovers  relative to Europe and China as global markets swoon anew. The operative  word is &ldquo;relative.&rdquo; No should expect the U.S. to prosper in some great  way from a 2012 crisis. It&rsquo;s that Europe and China will be far worse off  as contagion whips around the globe.</p>\r\n<p class="center">Bubbles, Imbalances</p>\r\n<p class="indent">&ldquo;When you look at the problems facing the world,  the bubbles and imbalances, America&rsquo;s are easier to fix than most,&rdquo;  Choyleva told me in Hong Kong yesterday. &ldquo;It says a lot about the state  of things globally.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class="indent">It would surprise few to imagine Europe having a  harder decade than the U.S. A Greek default is a given and may drag down  Portugal, Spain and, in the worst case, even Italy. Europe may be lucky  to get away with just one lost decade.</p>\r\n<p class="indent">Many would be taken aback to think that China,  too, might experience its share of setbacks compared with the U.S. Some  are well-known, including inflation that fans social unrest and a  financial crisis erupting as the massive stimulus of 2009 comes back to  haunt Beijing. All that investment created the illusion of economic  vitality. Too much of it was funneled into unproductive sectors of the  economy, setting up China for a banking meltdown.</p>\r\n<p class="center">Inflation China</p>\r\n<p class="indent">Choyleva adds a less obvious twist to the  critique: how China&rsquo;s financial proximity to the U.S. is a bigger  problem than many people appreciate. By tying itself to the dollar and  amassing more than $3 trillion of currency reserves, China essentially  merged with the U.S. financial system. When the Fed pumps money into the  economy, it inflates China more than America.</p>\r\n<p class="indent">There are rumblings in Washington about punishing  China for its undervalued currency. Yet China is only now realizing the  extent to which it surrendered sovereignty to the U.S. As the Fed adds  more cash to markets, China&rsquo;s inflation becomes more entrenched and  Beijing loses even more control. Over time, this dynamic will harm  China&rsquo;s competiveness more than if Beijing had allowed the yuan to  strengthen, as per the U.S.&rsquo;s demands.</p>\r\n<p class="indent">China could increase interest rates to temper  rising prices, but that would devastate growth. The thing about the G-2  is that pundits often view China as being in the stronger position --  its massive reserve holdings are both leverage and a fortification. Yet  China is trapped. It&rsquo;s addicted to cheap U.S. financing and is  increasingly feeling the side effects.</p>\r\n<p class="indent">For all its troubles, the U.S. has inherent  strengths: It&rsquo;s home to many of the world&rsquo;s top 20 universities; it has  institutions that may still get their act together in ways Europe can&rsquo;t;  a fertility rate that exceeds deaths, meaning America can ultimately  outgrow its debt -- unlike, say, Japan and Europe.</p>\r\n<p class="indent">If Japanese and European officials could travel  in time, it wouldn&rsquo;t be to fix mistakes of the past. If Chinese  officials don&rsquo;t act more assertively to tweak their model, they&rsquo;ll have  similar regrets a decade from now.</p>\r\n<p class="indent">(William Pesek is a Bloomberg View columnist.

Klaus Regling, head of the new financial bailout fund for the euro zone, went to Asia to drum up support.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChina has $3 trillion-plus in foreign exchange reserves, about a quarter invested in European bonds. But it is not only unseemly for wealthy Europeans to be looking for alms from China, it is bad policy. Beijing would undoubtedly try to use its financial leverage to silence European criticism of its cheap currency or its abysmal human rights record. That is too high of a price to pay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat makes this particularly misguided is that the European Union does not need the money. The main roadblock to fixing its mess is a lack of political will to use the resources it has. At $1.4 trillion, its entire bailout fund would amount to just over 10 percent of the euro area&rsquo;s G.D.P. Rich European countries &mdash; Germany notably &mdash; have ample access to finance.

The answer was simple: The tools he built helped change an  industry, even the world. &nbsp;The stuff he did mattered.</p>\r\n<p>Some light inside Jane turned on around that time; she had a new  mission. &nbsp;She would work in technology, and she would do it as a QA  engineer. &nbsp;She sat down with her friends and they all helped determine  the right path to get her where she wanted, if she was up to the  challenge.</p>\r\n<p>Keep in mind, this was late 2010. &nbsp;She had never written a single  line of code in her life. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t know what a command line was. &nbsp;She  had trouble understanding her smart phone.</p>\r\n<p>One of her friends at Google was studying for his master&rsquo;s after work.</p>\r\n<p>Jane followed suit and enrolled herself in the O&rsquo;Reilly School of  Technology for some crash courses on HTML/CSS/Javascript. &nbsp;Struggling  every step of the way, she poured her after work hours into learning the  way of front end development and basic web page manipulation. &nbsp;A few  months into it, she was applying for a new job as a QA engineer.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe it was bold determination or simple insanity that made her  apply for roles she was incredibly&nbsp;under-qualified&nbsp;for, but she was  thriving on the pain of failure. &nbsp;With every failed interview, she went  home and studied every question that was asked to her, thoroughly ripped  apart computer science topics that she never fathomed she would need to  know. &nbsp;As she studied, she felt that all this hard work was making her  lucky.</p>\r\n<p>That luck came as a black box tester for the Quipster app, an iPhone  app that would soon come out. &nbsp;She got the $50 gig, and - much like her  architect friend does - immediately slapped that project on her resume.  &nbsp;But she was hungry for more.</p>\r\n<p>Her confidence was bursting as she dove into Python as an after work  snack, just to hold her over while she applied for more jobs. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In early 2011, she landed a position as a full-time QA Tester for a  20 person startup in San Francisco. &nbsp;It was official; she was living in  the tech field now. &nbsp;But she wasn&rsquo;t coding. &nbsp;She wasn&rsquo;t necessarily  changing an industry. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At least Jane had a foot in the door. &nbsp;Now she could take a break.  &nbsp;Now she could float along and see where the company would take her.  &nbsp;Right?</p>\r\n<p>Wrong. &nbsp;Her Eventbrite friend is what one might call a brogrammer.  &nbsp;Besides being a douche, he attends events and tries to marry  engineering and his social life together in harmony. &nbsp;Jane decided that  was a good idea. &nbsp;Ruby was the language of choice for QA automation in  her company, so she took on the endeavor to learn Ruby and apply it to  Watir (tool of choice). &nbsp;She started going to automation meetups for  Selenium and Watir. &nbsp;Soon those meetups multiplied into women&rsquo;s Rubyist  meetups, weekly study groups, and hackathons. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Six months later, she was confident that she was ready to execute her  master plan. &nbsp;She applied for a company called PocketGems, and simply  knocked them dead on the interview, but she didn&rsquo;t necessarily want to  leave her startup for PocketGems. &nbsp;She just wanted to make a real  difference.</p>\r\n<p>With just a little guidance from her friends (she still needs to work  on her negotiation skills), she leveraged the offer at PG to promote  her to full QA Automation Engineer at her current company. &nbsp;She finally  got what she wanted.</p>\r\n<p>Today, Jane doesn&rsquo;t know what the celebrity gossip is. &nbsp;The neural  pathways that closed down during her tenure as customer support were  bulldozed and paved as super highways.</p>\r\n<p>In 9 months, she went from never writing code in her life, to writing  code every day. &nbsp;She tripled her salary. &nbsp;She has job satisfaction.  &nbsp;The tools she solidifies helps change an industry for the better. &nbsp;Jane  does things that matter.</p>\r\n<p>PS -&nbsp;Jane also learned how to speak Chinese during these 9 months.</p>\r\n<p>Bottom line: If the main topic of conversation you have with your  friends is not how you can better yourself, you need to get new friends.</p>\r\n<p>Source:&nbsp; <a href="http://bufr.tumblr.com/post/12126279275/you-are-the-average-of-your-five-closest-friends" target="_blank">http://bufr.tumblr.com/post/12126279275/you-are-the-average-of-your-five-closest-friends</a></p>', 0, '', '2011-11-09 07:43:20'),

(30, 1, 'The difference between sparkling wine and champagne', '<p>Sparkling Wine vs Champagne<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSparkling wine is white wine with enough levels of carbon dioxide to make the drink bubbly. Sparkling wine produced in the Champagne region of France is called champagne.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Madrid Treaty of 1891 gave France legal protection against the use of the name Champagne for sparkling wine produced anywhere else in the world. Sparkling wine may be produced by any of the methods including carbonating normal wine and seal the bottle which is actually the same process of making soft drinks. However, Champagne is made strictly in accordance to the regulations and procedures approved by Comit?? Interprofessionel du Vin de Champagne (CIVC). More and more countries are signing trade agreements with the European Union to protect and stop the usage of Champagne in their countries. This has curbed the usage of the name champagne and most wine producers worldwide have started calling their produce sparkling wine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most common method used in France for producing is by &lsquo;methode champenoise&rsquo; or the champagne method. This process basically consists of the secondary fermentation happening in the bottle. After the primary fermentation and bottling certain amount of selected yeast and sugar are added in the bottle and it is closed with a crown cap. The wine is then left to age for a minimum prescribed period. On completion of this period the bottled are taken out and placed in special racks at a 45 degrees angle. They are taken out every few days and slightly shaken and then replaced in the racks at a slightly steeper angle. This process continues till the bottles are pointing straight down. This process ensures that the sediment of the yeast settles in the neck. The neck is then frozen and the cap removed pushing the sediment out. The bottle is quickly toped up and corked.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChampagne has long been associated with a luxurious lifestyle and celebration, however, wine is used as a normal everyday drink. The phrase sparkling wine really does not invite the same feelings as champagne does. It has been probably this difference that has lead to France insisting on protecting the usage of the word.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSummary<br />\r\n1.Sparkling wine is any white wine with bubbles while Champagne is sparkling wine produced in Champagne region of France.<br />\r\n2.Sparkling wine may be produced by any of the methods while Champagne is produced by the Champagne Method.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>起泡酒与香槟的区别<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n正宗的香槟（Champagne）是一个品牌，并享受法律保护。它有别于普通香槟。即便一位来自意大利的酿酒商已满足了香槟所有的品质要求，他还是无法跨越最后一道屏障：他的酒不是产自法国正宗香槟区。因此，与其它此类酒一样，虽然其加工方法相同，但这些葡萄汽酒都不被允许贴上任何与正宗的&ldquo;香槟&rdquo; （Champagne）有关的商标。如下的一个真实案例体现出这一商标规定是何其之严：瑞士有一个葡萄酒产区，也叫&ldquo;香槟镇&rdquo;，那文章来源于中国红酒网里的酿酒商想当然地为自己的汽酒取名为&ldquo;Vin de Champagne&rdquo;。愤怒的法国人把他们告上了处理此类纠纷的欧洲最高法庭&mdash;&mdash;欧盟法院，并且胜诉。自此，瑞士同行被禁止在商标或者广告用语中使用自己的家乡名称。<br />\r\n<br />\r\n不过，世界各地也出产一些高品质的汽酒，不仅加工工艺与正宗香槟毫无二致，甚至其质量水准与某些品牌香槟相比也毫不逊色。例如西班牙的&ldquo;Cavas&rdquo;，法国的&ldquo;Cr&eacute;mant&rdquo;，德国的&ldquo;Sekt&rdquo;。</p>', 0, '', '2011-11-10 14:11:21'),

For example, in Zhengzhou, he  and his band had to try hard and use all kinds of games to motivate the  participants, who were shy. On the contrary, the audience in Zhuhai was  passionately active.

He liked to drive his people into war fighting with neighboring states. One day, he met Mencius, and asked: &quot; As a king, I think I govern the state fairly well.&nbsp; If there is a famine due to crop failure in the north of yellow river, I move some starving people to the south and transport food to the north. So the people won''t starve to death. Vice versa when there is famine in the south. I also know the practice of neighboring rulers, not a single like me is intended to do best for the sake of their own people. But I don''t understand, people in the neighboring states do not flee, and the population in my state has not increased at all.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMencius answered: &quot; You like to fight. Let''s make an analogy with fighting.&nbsp; In the battlefield, two armies confront each other. The fighting starts with steady drum sound. Soldiers from both sides now engage in combat, killing mercilessly. After a while, the winning side forges ahead and the losing side starts to collapse and flee.&nbsp; Among the fleeing soldiers, some run fast, stop after 100 steps; some run slower, stop at 50 steps. Now the slow 50-step soldiers laugh at the fast 100-step soldiers that they are cowards. Do you think they deserve this kind of ridicule?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe King replied: &quot; No. The slow 50 step soldiers just have not reached 100 steps.

Chinese students now account for more than 21 percent of all foreigners who come to the U.S. for post-secondary schooling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout 14 percent of foreign students come from India, while 10 percent hail from South Korea, the report says. Canada and Taiwan round out the top five, with 3.8 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore than 720,000 international students came to the U.S. in 2010, a 4.7 percent increase from a year earlier. Analysts see the trend as confirmation that the U.S. remains the leader in higher education and a magnet for the best and brightest from around the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome foreign students, however, quickly pack up and return to their native countries after graduation, using the knowledge and skills they gained in the U.S. to benefit competing economies. Others choose to stick around and go to work for American companies, while some continue their education elsewhere. Proponents of foreign education believe that, even if the U.S. educates some of its competitors, the overall effect will benefit each nation involved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Educational exchange in both directions furthers business and cultural ties between the United States and other countries,&rdquo; said Institute of International Education President Allan Goodman.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile nearly all universities host at least a few foreigners, schools in New York, Texas and California dominate the market with 33 percent of all international students, according to the report. The University of Southern California leads the way with 8,615 international students. The University of Illinois, New York University, Purdue University and Columbia University each attracted more than 7,000 last year, and 13 other universities drew more than 5,000.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUSC and other schools use their diverse populations to market themselves to prospective students.

The United Kingdom remains the most frequent destination for Americans, and analysts believe the reason is simple: Students studying in the U.K. don&rsquo;t need to learn another language, as they would if they spent a year in Italy, Spain or France.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut federal officials on Monday urged more students to embrace the challenges of attending college outside the country, suggesting that the practice helps build a more well-rounded workforce capable of competing with the rest of the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;There is no substitute for living in a foreign country, communicating in another language and understanding cultures, institutions and traditions,&rdquo; said Ann Stock, assistant secretary of state, during an address at the National Press Club, where the report was released. &ldquo;We need more students choosing to study abroad.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/nov/14/china-increases-pace-in-foreign-student-contingent/" target="_blank">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/nov/14/china-increases-pace-in-foreign-student-contingent/</a></p>', 0, '', '2011-11-16 21:44:58'),

So we really had our guard  up, we thought&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>We started with lunch at a local Dim Sum restaurant on the  waterfront. A short taxi ride for 10RNB, about $1.35US. I&rsquo;m not much of  an adventurous eater, but there was plenty of food I really liked. Even  the salmon sashimi was excellent. We had congee soup, tea, custard  tarts, shrimp dim sum, beef ribs &ndash; it was all good. And only cost about  $12US each. Was told if he hadn&rsquo;t gone crazy on Western style desserts,  the meal might have only cost us about $5 a piece.</p>\r\n<p>Back to the border gate for shopping. Zhuhai is the place to go for  anything bootleg. We were instruced &ldquo;assume everything is fake, nothing  is real. In DVD stores you do not barter, but you can barter with  vendors.&rdquo; In Hong Kong a really good deal on a Rolex copy is $250HK  ($31US). But in Zhuhai there are Rolex copies going for as low as $50RNB  ($7US). Gucci, Diesel and Calvin Klein (or &ldquo;Calven Kline&rdquo;) are  everywhere. A DVD goes for $8-12RNB ($1.10 to $1.60US). PC software  (even Windows, XP and Photoshop) for $22RNB ($3.20US). The complete  seven episodes of Seinfeld for $250RNB ($35US) and three seasons of  Boston Legal for $150RNB ($20US). Of course everything for sale is  bootleg. A complete set of PING golf clubs including bag with wheels at  an OPENING price of $1350RNB ($170US roughly), which would probably  easily go for $800RNB ($105US) or less.</p>\r\n<p>We talked about the artists that create the originals of this  merchandise. Like the research and development that goes into creating  new lines of gold clubs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the manufacturing that costs money,  it&rsquo;s the R&amp;D&rdquo;. And also about the actors and performance artists  that are not making any money on the counterfeit items.</p>\r\n<p>The other side of the coin is that very few Chinese residents could  afford to shell out $150RNB ($20US) for the real deal. We were told that  many day laborers in China make a MONTHLY salary of $800RNB ($105US).  It&rsquo;s a little difficult for us to understand that people can live on  that. People have told us &ldquo;Macau is expensive&rdquo; but it doesn&rsquo;t seem  expensive to us. In fact, people will say &ldquo;Macau is expensive, but not  for you.&rdquo; So we were really amazed how low the prices were in mainland  China.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img width="300" height="225" src="/web/article/zhuhai-gongbei_gate.jpg" alt="" /></p>\r\n<p>Gongbei gate between Macau &amp; Zhuhai</p>\r\n<p>Ok, so maybe you&rsquo;re waiting for my pickpocket story. We left the main  front shopping area at the border gate and walked a ways into town.  Here were the typical outdoor street vendors with the cheezy stalls and  cardboard tables with goods. A lot of the same stuff &ndash; but with the  addition of animals (doves, turtles, rabbits, parrots, fish), everyday  cheap clothes and stuff for the household.</p>\r\n<p>As we made our way into the main square in Zhuhai we ended up walking  down a sort of alley with a building to our left and a fence on the  right. No vendors, just us walking down this about a block and I was at  the rear of our wagon train. I have my backpack securely on one strap  off one shoulder. I didn&rsquo;t want to wear it on my back because of  pickpockets. I feel a light tug, turn around and there&rsquo;s this kid about  14 smoking a cigarette with his hand on the zipper of my backpack. I see  red, I am SO pissed off &ndash; and this kid just looks at me like &ldquo;what are  you going to do?&rdquo;. And he&rsquo;s right, what WAS I going to do? Nothing, just  kept walking. But after that we all held our backpacks backwards on our  fronts like holding a baby. I am curious how long he was trailing us  and waiting for the right moment.</p>\r\n<p>After that I really felt like we all had a big bullseye on us. We  didn&rsquo;t see many other Westerners on our little day trip &ndash; Maybe 10 all  day. The traffic patterns in Zhuhai are also very crazy to what we are  used to. We saw people seriously almost mowed over by a moped. It was a  little scary for us. We realized we have been very insulated by living  in Macau, which in 2008 is now a reasonably safe place to live.</p>\r\n<p>I definately would not go to Zhuhai in the future alone, and I would  be very careful about your belongings. Not just careful &ndash; I would lock  everything up and keep it in front of you at all times.</p>\r\n<p>Our guide also told us not to stand very close to the street when  waiting for taxis on the sidewalks. She said it&rsquo;s not uncommon for a  moped to blaze by and grab your bags as they pass.</p>\r\n<p>Another local tip: If you do buy DVD&rsquo;s in Zhuhai, make the merchant  play them on their DVD player for you. Have been told it&rsquo;s very common  for merchants to sell DVD&rsquo;s and software that don&rsquo;t work.</p>\r\n<p><img width="290" height="218" src="/web/article/guangdong_outline_map.jpg" alt="" /></p>\r\n<br />\r\n<div style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3367">\r\n<p class="wp-caption-text">Guandong Province - China</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The other side of Zhuhai? One of Zhuhai&rsquo;s international accolades  include &ldquo;the Best Model of International Residential Environment  Improvement&rdquo; awarded by the United Nations. It&rsquo;s also known as a city of  gardens and flowers.</p>\r\n<p>Our guide told us that anytime you have a border between two  countries, there are always going to be problems like pickpockets, scams  and saavy vendors. Made me think of Tijuana, Mexico back near home in  the US. When you cross the border you are very vulnerable. And as I  learned recently from a local Macau native: &ldquo;Americans are very  vulnerable targets because they have good hearts and are very naiive.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I think that&rsquo;s all true. Looking forward to when I&rsquo;m more &ldquo;seasoned&rdquo;  in Asia and don&rsquo;t keep getting taken left and right. But being a Ghylo  American, I think my chances are slim&hellip;</p>', 0, 'http://www.conradaskland.com/blog/2008/11/first-trip-to-zhuhai-china/', '2011-12-03 06:50:03'),

It features flat  terrain, crisscrossed rivers, numerous, bridges, lanes and ceilinged  corridors.</p>\r\n<p>Ceilinged corridors are the most special scene in Xitang  construction. These corridors were originally built to make convenience  for the residents trading on boats by the side of the rivers. Each shop  has a ceiling over the stone-slate road in front of its own house, and  the ceilings connect with one another to form corridors. the longest  ceiling stretches 1,300 meters, like a silk belt winding along the  river.</p>\r\n<p>Another feature of Xitang is the ancient architecture which was  well-preserved from the Ming and Qing Dynasty. there are a total of 122  lanes, long and short, wide and narrow. Five of them are longer than 100  meters. Among all the lanes, Shipi lane is the most famous.</p>\r\n<p><img width="250" height="236" src="/web/article/xitang.jpg" alt="" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Transportation</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Highway:</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Shanghai-Xitang:</strong> Special tourist bus line leaves from Shanghai at 9:00 am at the weekends.

It is situated at  the west side of Zhongfu hall in the west street, with a total length of  68 meters. the lane is about 1 meter at the widest but the narrowest  point is only 80 centimeters. It is paved with 166 stone planks which  are only 3 centimeters thick, which is really hard to be chisel from the  granite. That is why it is called Shipi (the skin of the stone) lane.

In  French, cabaret means a small show usually performed in a small room  where the audience sits at tiny tables, and where stars and tyros alike  face no restrictions on the types of music or genre or combinations  thereof. Cabaret performers can experiment with avant-garde material  never before presented, and can &ldquo;personally&rdquo; interact with the audience.  It is a little theatre where the atmosphere is loose and old friends  are pleased to converse with the performers, Ines explained.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nCabaret was popular in Europe with deep roots in France, Germany,  Austria, Italy and even Shanghai from the 1920s to the &lsquo;40s. Cabaret  Lilibelle, with classical jazz from the &lsquo;20s and &lsquo;30s and with a little  love story in between, staged a revival of the performance by combining  famous songs of world-renowned authors such as Cole Porter and Ira and  George Gershwin. They came up with the idea and, after a few months,  made it a compact, she continued.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nBerislav sat behind a red electronic grand piano in a corner of the  restaurant while Ines stood beside him singing with slight movements.  Wearing a long pearl necklace, red-lipped Ines fit the role with short  black curly hair and a long red skirt. Playing the role of Lilibelle,  she narrated the love story before singing each song.<br />\r\nComposed of two 45-minute parts, the mini concert tells of singer  Lilibelle&rsquo;s love for a man named Johnny. One day, Johnny suddenly  disappears, and the girl travels around Europe, the Americas, and other  places in search of him while singing songs of the countries. The story  ends with Lilibelle still on a quest to find Johnny.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nInes started with a song titled Welcome to greet the audience. Her  magnetic voice and delicate performance along with the easy-going jazz  stirred memories of the golden jazz years and brought back the scenes in  black &lsquo;n white movies, dancing theatre, scarlet-lipped ladies in long  evening gowns and elegant gentlemen with top hats and tailcoats.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nAfter Welcome, came Night &lsquo;n Day, I Got Rhythm and The Man That I Love.  The second part consisted of Johnny, When Is Your Birthday? St Louis  Blues, Let&rsquo;s Misbehave, All of Me, I&rsquo;m Maria and Life Like a Rose. The  songs revealed the girl&rsquo;s inner mind including happiness and sorrow as  well as her yearning for love. Their performance garnered great  applause.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt was their first visit to China and Zhuhai was chosen as their first  destination, Ines explained. Further performances might be conducted in  Macao.<br />\r\nThe revived cabaret has a select audience in Croatia, which is part of  the cabaret tradition, Berislav noted. Although Shanghai was  world-famous for its jazz and cabarets in the 1930s &ndash; and still has  cabarets along the Bund, the Zhuhai audience felt somewhat shy and  astonished by the style of performance, he confessed.</p>\r\n<p>-By Betty Lin, Zhuhai Daily</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', 0, 'http://deltabridges.com/news/zhuhai-news/love-week-cabaret-zhuhai', '2011-12-09 22:36:02'),

Although that, the google map tool in the mobile will be a good guider for you. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n3, The downtown has mountains you can climb. The mountains are not high. Zhuhai has Bai Lian Dong park(白莲洞公园). Xiamen has Hu Wei mountain(狐尾山).</p>\r\n<p>4, Unlike other cities like Hangzhou, Beijing or Suzhou, you don''t need to buy any travel tickets.&nbsp; The travel is nature and free for the most of travel places.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe difference:<br />\r\n1, Zhuhai Qinglv Road(情侣路) is longer than Xiamen Huangdao Road(环岛路). There are many small islands around Zhuhai. Xiamen has only Gulang island which is the most popular travel point in Fujian Province. When I was at zhuhai, I tried to walk from Gongbei(供北) to Tangjia(唐家). It''s too long to finish the walk. Finally, I decided to take a taxi finally. Huangdao Road is different, I think anyone in the Huangdao Road of Xiamen can take a bike. It''s also very enjoyable. It started from Xiamen university(厦门大学) and ended at Wu Yuan Wan(五缘湾).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2, Zhuhai has more universities than Xiamen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3, Bai Lian Dong park(白莲洞公园) in Zhuhai has a longer history. Lots of tourists who come to Zhuhai will go to climb the mountain.&nbsp; Huwei mountain(狐尾山) in Xiamen is unknown for the people. Even now, only a few people know it.</p>\r\n<p>4, Lots of people from Hunan province and Guangxi province working in Zhuhai.&nbsp; The people stay at Xiamen are from Fujian province mostly.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There is an interesting thing.&nbsp; Lots of Shanghai people go to Xiamen for travel. They talk much about xiamen. But nobody or few people talk about Zhuhai.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, Zhuhai has more travel points than Xiamen. Because Zhuhai is close to Macau, Hongkong, Guangzhou, Shenzhen. There are many small interesting islands beside Zhuhai too.&nbsp; I guess that because there are not too many Shanghai people travel in Zhuhai. Otherwise they will hope to come to Zhuhai, not Xiamen.</p>\r\n<p>I still wish that Zhuhai could be kept unknown for the people. This will help keep the city clean and not crowd.

(10, 1, 'How to improve your work efficiency', 'There is an article about that\r\n\r\nWork at 85% Capacity with 100% Focus\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the chief goals of living the creative life is to do to it for the long-term. There’s a time and a place for sprints, but, without careful integration, sprints often make your work incoherent and deplete you at the same time.\r\n\r\nAt a gut level, we know this. We understand that this is more of a marathon for us – why else invest so much of ourselves in it and dream of a life where we get to do it? – but we resist the idea of the steady pace of creative productivity. (In another post at another time, I’ll list some of the myths around creative productivity that are the foundations of this resistance.)\r\n\r\nWe need to reassess what it means to work at 100%. Working at 100% capacity is depleting and short-sighted, but working with 100% focus is incredibly effective, optimal, and the key to finishing your creative work. Rather than thinking about working at 100%, try to work at 85% capacity with 100% focus.\r\n\r\nIt may seem that this is giving less than everything you’ve got – because it is – but by keeping a little capacity in the tank every day, you can stop the sprint/crash cycle that seems to be a natural part of the creative life. Save a little every day so you can do more over the course of a week.\r\nCapacity and Margin\r\n\r\nOne of the key tenets of the Dojo is the idea of leaving some margin. Like capacity, margin is one of those ideas that we understand but can be a bit hard to define. That makes sense, though, because margin and capacity are relational concepts: margin is the difference between your total capacity and how much of that capacity you’re using.\r\n\r\nImagine that you have 8 hours of time to work in a given day. Those 8 hours are your (time) capacity. Planning to use every minute of those 8 hours working is not leaving any margin. Your total capacity is allocated, so if anything were to happen that prevented you from working those full 8 hours, you’ll inevitably have to drop something you’ve planned to do.\r\n\r\nConsider your work patterns. How likely is it that you’ll use those 8 full hours at full capacity? How likely is it that something will either interrupt or distract you?\r\n\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\nHow often, though, do you implicitly assume that 8 hours of capacity equals 8 hours of work done?\r\n\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\nFollowing this same case, working at 85% capacity means assuming that you’ll plan to do a little shy of 7 hours of work. If something comes up – and it inevitably does – then you still have enough (time) capacity to handle it and complete what you set out to do. Or if you underestimate how long something should take – and we inevitably do – you can still finish your key projects and call it a day.\r\n\r\n(In case you think that the time you’ll spend on a project scales with the time you have available, you might want to check out my piece on how time crunching prevents your best creative work.)\r\n\r\nAs you get more in tune with your workflow, you’ll also get more intuitive about what capacity means for you. Capacity is really time, energy, and attention, and it’s the energy and attention that are both the hardest to quantify and the ones that are limiting factor for creative work. Margin has the greatest effect on your energy reserves, with energy being understood as your physical, emotional, social, and mental energy.\r\n\r\nThere’s a reason why marathoners don’t run at a full sprint – they’d never finish the race if they did. What’s true of the physical is also true of the other aspects of our lives. That 15% margin gives you the additional resources to take care of yourself and continue the next day without burnout.\r\n100% Focus: Giving Fewer Things Your Full Concentration\r\n\r\nLet’s separate focus from attention since we sometimes use them interchangeably. By focus, I mean keeping the fewest number of things on your list as possible and making it a priority to get them done. By focusing, we stop the habit of project shuffling and instead concentrate our resources on completing projects.\r\n\r\nIf you’re struggling to finish the projects you’re currently working on, adding another item to the list isn’t going to help you. Finishing one item on the list will.\r\n\r\nThis principle of focus works on the different levels of action perspective. If you try to do too many tasks at once, you end up not completing any. If you try to handle too many projects in a given day or week, you end up spending a lot of time in project management mode. If you try to handle too many objectives per month, they all suffer.\r\n\r\nThe key to getting more done is to focus on completing fewer things. Imagine that you were able to complete one project a day every day. At the end of the month, that’s 30 projects. How much better off would you be at that rate than you are now?\r\n\r\nFor what it’s worth, 3 projects a day seems to be a good, sustainable goal that balances everything that actually needs to get done with what we can do consistently. 3 projects completed per day equals 90 projects per month.\r\nCompletion + Consistency = Long-Term Flourishing\r\n\r\nWorking at 85% capacity with 100% focus gets you the consistent completion that builds the type of creative life where you’re not just thinking, dreaming, planning, talking, and hoping, but where you’re actually doing.\r\n\r\nThink about all of the creative people around you. Who are the dreamers? Who are the doers? I bet it didn’t take long for you to come up with names of both. Which do you want to be?\r\n\r\nIn every domain I can think of, the people who are the most regarded are the doers. The thing that separates successful entrepreneurs and business-people often isn’t a killer idea – it’s their execution. Successful managers actually get results. Leaders have teams that get stuff done. What separates authors from every one else is that authors actually write books. Musicians get on stage.\r\n\r\nThe doers not only get the social rewards, but they get the personal satisfaction of actualizing their best selves. This, of course, assumes that they aren’t just mindlessly doing stuff. We become by doing, but whether we’re becoming cogs or our best selves depends on how principled our actions are.\r\n\r\nBut it’s not just about doing something once. It’s about doing it repeatedly. If you’re a regular reader of this website, you’re a regular reader because you anticipate that I’ll write something worth reading. Even when I miss the mark, you still hang around because you assume that the missed step was an exception to the rule.\r\n\r\nWhat’s true for me and the people you put in the “doer” list above is true for you. Don’t just do great work once or sporadically – do it consistently, for the long haul. And do it by working at 85% capacity with 100% focus.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.productiveflourishing.com/work-at-85-capacity-with-100-focus/', 21, '2011-11-08 07:11:33', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

It was a large celebration.\r\n\r\n一个男人和他的女朋友结婚，举行了一场盛大的结婚庆典。\r\n\r\nAll of their friends and family came to see the lovely ceremony and to partake of the festivities and celebrations. All had a wonderful time. The bride was gorgeous in her white wedding gown and the groom was very dashing in his black tuxedo. Everyone could tell that the love they had for each other was true.\r\n\r\n所有的朋友和家人都来到结婚典礼上参加欢宴和庆祝活动。大家都过得很开心。穿着白色婚纱的新娘漂亮迷人，穿着黑色礼服的新郎英俊潇洒。每个人都能看出他们彼此的爱是真诚的。\r\n\r\nA few months later, the wife came to the husband with a proposal, "I read in a magazine, a while ago, about how we can strengthen our marriage," she offered. "Each of us will write a list of the things that we find a bit annoying with the other person. Then, we can talk about how we can fix them together and make our lives happier together."\r\n\r\n几个月后，妻子走近丈夫提议说：“我刚才在杂志上看到一篇文章，说的是怎样巩固婚姻。”她说：“我们两个人都各自把对方的小毛病列在一张纸上，然后我们商量一下怎样解决，以使我们的生活更幸福。”\r\n\r\nThe husband agreed. So each of them went to a separate room in the house and thought of the things that annoyed them about the other. They thought about this question for the rest of the day and wrote down what they came up with. The next morning, at the breakfast table, they decided that they would go over their lists.\r\n\r\n丈夫同意了。于是他们各自走向不同的房间去想对方的缺点。那一天余下的时间里，他们都在思考这个问题，并且把他们想到的都写下来。第二天早上，吃早饭的时候，他们决定谈谈彼此的缺点。\r\n\r\n"I''ll start," offered the wife. She took out her list. It had many items on it, enough to fill three pages. In fact, as she started reading the list of the little annoyances, she noticed that tears were starting to appear in her husband''s eyes.\r\n\r\n“我先开始吧。”妻子说。她拿出她的单子，上面列举了很多条，事实上，足足写满了三页。当她开始念的时候，她注意到丈夫眼里含着泪花。\r\n\r\n"What''s wrong?" she asked. "Nothing," the husband replied, "keep reading your list."\r\n\r\n“怎么啦?”她问。“没什么，”丈夫答道，“继续念吧。”\r\n\r\nThe wife continued to read until she had read all three pages to her husband. She neatly placed her list on the table and folded her hands over the top of it.\r\n\r\n妻子又接着念。整整三页都念完之后她把单子整齐地放在桌上，两手交叉放在上面。\r\n\r\n"Now, you read your list and then we''ll talk about the things on both of our lists," she said happily.\r\n\r\n“现在该你念了，然后我们谈谈所列举的缺点。”她高兴地说。\r\n\r\nQuietly the husband stated, "I don''t have anything on my list. I think that you are perfect the way that you are. I don''t want you to change anything for me. You are lovely and wonderful and I wouldn''t want to try and change anything about you." The wife, touched by his honesty and the depth of his love for her and his acceptance of her, turned her head and wept.\r\n\r\n丈夫平静地说：“我什么也没写，我觉得像你这样就很完美了，我不想让你为我改变什么。你很可爱迷人，我不想让你改变。”妻子被丈夫的诚实和对她深深的爱和接纳感动了，她转过头去哭起来。\r\n\r\nIn life, there are enough times when we are disappointed, depressed and annoyed. We don''t really have to go looking for them. We have a wonderful world that is full of beauty, light and promise. Why waste time in this world looking for the bad, disappointing or annoying when we can look around us, and see the wondrous things before us?\r\n\r\n生命中我们有很多的失望、沮丧和烦恼，我们根本不需要寻找。我们美妙的世界充满了美丽、光明、希望。但是，当我们放眼四周时，为什么浪费时间寻找不快、失望和烦恼，而看不到我们面前的美好事物呢？ ', 20, '2011-11-24 10:49:37', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

Hopefully, you will, too.        </p>', 'http://www.mysteriousandmisplaced.com', '2011-11-20 10:39:58');
